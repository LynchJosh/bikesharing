# Bikesharing with Tableau


##	Overview

The purpose of this project was to use data from Citi bike to gather insights into their user base to determine if the bike rental service could be made in another city. Using the provided data I was able to convert time-duration using the to_datetime() method to convert the times to easier to read data. After converting the time I made it  a CSV file. I used Tableau to make visualizers that could be given to investors to give them an idea of the project.

##  Summary
The purpose of this project was to use data from Citi Bike to gather insights into their user base to determine if the bike rental service could be replicated in another city. Tableau is a powerful visualization tool that can make easy-to-read charts for end users. If I had additional charts I would add Heat maps that show all the bikes' ids to see how much wear and tear is put on them to determine how ofter they would need repairs.
